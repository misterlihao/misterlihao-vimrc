### Notice

This git repository is supposed to be cloned into  
`~/`  
Not into  
`~/misterlihao-vimrc`

### Install

Following script does it:
```bash
cd ~
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/misterlihao/misterlihao-vimrc.git
git pull origin master
```
You have to remove all files colliding with the project before `pull`.
(The script still works though you keep the directories).
